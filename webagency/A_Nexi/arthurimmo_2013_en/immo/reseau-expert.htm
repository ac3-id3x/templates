					<h2 class="xxbiggest typo-black margin-top-10 nocase">Estate Agent</h2>
					<p class="">An estate agent is a professional who acts as an intermediary in property sales.<br />
					In France, the profession is regulated by the Loi Hoguet, or the Hoguet Law, and to work in the field, an estate agent must :
						<ul>
							<li>- Hold a professional certificate (carte professionnelle) issued by the civil service. </li> 
							<li>- Take out an insurance policy underwriting his or her professional liability.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p class="bold typo-black">It is imperative that the estate agent have written authority signed by his or her client to conduct searches, negotiate or sign bills of sale in the client’s name and on the client’s behalf.</p>
					
					<h2 class="xxbiggest typo-black margin-top-20 nocase">The Certified Property Expert</h2>
					<p>A certified property expert is a professional who specialises in working out a property’s precise value (Real Estate Appraisal).<br />
					A certified property expert is tasked with defining the sale and/or rental value of a business or company, precisely and with complete impartiality.<br />
					The property expert acts to guarantee complete fairness during a property transaction.</p>
	
					<p class="bold typo-black">When carrying out his or her tasks, the property expert drafts a valuation report and commits his or her professional liability.</p>

				<p>The sale or purchase of a property is without a doubt one of the most important financial commitments a person can make in their life, a fully sufficient reason to consider that a property must never be given an approximate valuation.</p>
				<p>Whether you are a property buyer or seller, or wish to learn the value of your property, only an expert assessment of the market value can precisely define the value of your property and guarantee complete fairness in a property transaction.</p>
				<p class="bold">This expert property valuation must be performed by a specialist : a certified property expert.</p>

				<p class="big line-height-22 padding-bottom-0">« We’d like to offer our testimony on our dealings with the Arthurimmo agency in Arcachon. My wife and I had a plan that was both simple and complicated: to sell our house in Arcachon and buy a new apartment in the town centre. We called on an agency in Aiguillon that was part of the Arthurimmo network to value our house so we could learn its real value.<br>Following the report, we agreed to sell our house through the agency exclusively, who sold it at the price in the report in under 4 months, which meant we could buy the new apartment we wanted with the same agency. »</p>
