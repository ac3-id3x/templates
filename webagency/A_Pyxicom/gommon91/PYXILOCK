I woke up out that coma, two thousand and one
Bout the same time Dre dropped two thousand and one
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude Volume 1
Rap critics politicin
Wanna know the outcome!
Ready to die, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle in one
I feel like Pac, after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind the G-Series and All Eyez On Me
I watched the death of a dynasty!
So I told VIBE MAGAZINE
Workin' with Dr.Dre was a (dream)
I had visions of makin a classic
Then my world turned black, like I was starin outta Stevie Wonders glasses
Its kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Comin back from a fatal accident, to beat makin and rappin
But, we da future
Whitney Houston told me that, it's gonna take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

Rushin in this 40 ounce
Lettin the ink from my pen bleed
Cuz Marthin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream)
Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (brought you all my dreeam)

[sample playin its cuz I love you!]

I had dreams of fuckin an R'n'B bitch like Mya
When i saw dat ass on a front of that King
Read the article in a magazine
She loved gangsters,loved nasty things
So im the glass house havin' nasty dreams!
Good girls neva' give it up
But anything is possible ,if 50 fucked Vivica
Heard of lifes obstacles,found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like,Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of bein' Unsigned Hype
Till i was crushed my Dave Mase,almost let my pen fall asleep on a page
Daydreamin yesterday
Dozin offback stage
I tought i saw Eazy talkin to Jam Master Jay
So i walked over heard Jam Master say
Its a hardknock life,then you pass away
They say sleep is the cousin' of death
So my eyes wide open cuz a dream is kin to ya last breath

Rushin in this 40 ounce
Lettin the ink from my pen bleed
Cuz Marthin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream)
Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (brought you all my dream)

[sample playin its cuz I love you!]

The Dream of Huey Newton, thats what im livin' through
The Dream of Eric Wright, thats what im givin you!
Who walk through the Whitehouse without a business suit?
Compton had Jerry Curl drippin' on Ronald Reagens shoes
Gave Mike Lim my demo came here to pay my dues
Started of with Whoo Kid then i started blazin Clue
It was all a Dream like BIG sait it be
Dont sleep on me homie i BRING NIGHTMARERS TO REALITY
Rap Phenomenon defyin' the rulez of gravity
Studied all the classic start revisin my strategy
Cuz Marshall Mathers made it
Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds wonderin where the hell Marvin Gaye went?
How do i say this,im livin for my son but i can't figure,
Why im at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus Piece like a Cathlic Nun
The War to be a rap legend had just begun'

Rushin in this 40 ounce
Lettin the ink from my pen bleed
Cuz Marthin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream)
Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (brought you all my dreeam)

[sample playin its cuz I love you!]

This song is dedicated to Yutandey Price the sister of Venus and Serena Williams
Who was slain during a gang shoutout in Compton
Sunday September 14th 2003, Rest in peace!
