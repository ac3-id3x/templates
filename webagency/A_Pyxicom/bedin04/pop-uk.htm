      <p class=MsoNormal align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If 
        you already know the Gironde region, you will already be aware of its 
        many attractions and the huge diversity of landscape it offers, from the 
        rolling hills and fortified towns of Entre-Deux-Mers in the East, the 
        Bordeaux vineyards and chateaux bordering the Gironde estuary, and the 
        Atlantic coast to the west. <br>
        If you are interested in buying, selling or renting a property in the 
        Gironde, then Cabinet Bedin has all the expertise and resources you need, 
        combined with an extensive understanding of the region based on nearly 
        25 years of experience.<br>
        Founded in 1978 by President and CEO Yvette BEDIN, the business continues 
        to expand, now providing its customers with the resources of 24 agencies. 
        We currently have over 2000 properties on our books representing the great 
        diversity of the Gironde and the Landes.<br>
        I like to think that one of the secrets of our success is the emphasis 
        we place on maintaining excellent communications with our customers. Another 
        is our attention to detail. As a property expert herself, Madame Bedin 
        places great emphasis on guiding customers through the legal complexities 
        of the French property market. So you really are in safe hands with Cabinet 
        BEDIN.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
        am delighted to be part of the Cabinet BEDIN team with special responsibility 
        for our growing number of English speaking customers. 
        Please don't hesitate to contact me personally for help or advice, even
